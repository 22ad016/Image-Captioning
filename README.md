Image Captioning
This Python project leverages the power of Transformers to generate captions for images using the ViT-GPT2 model. The model is capable of providing descriptive captions for a wide range of images.

Key Features:
Transformers Integration: The project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to load and utilize the ViT-GPT2 model for image captioning.

Image Processing: It incorporates image feature extraction and caption generation, making it easy to generate captions for images fetched from the internet or locally stored.

Interactive Captioning: Users can input an image URL, and the program will retrieve and display the image. After processing the image, it generates a caption that describes the image content.

Caption Generation Options: The program allows for both greedy and non-greedy (sampling-based) caption generation. Users can select their preferred caption generation approach for diverse results.

Customization: Developers and users can fine-tune the image captioning process by adjusting generation parameters such as maximum length, top-k, and top-p probabilities.

Visual Output: The generated caption is displayed alongside the input image, providing a rich visual experience for users.

This project is an exciting demonstration of the capabilities of ViT-GPT2 models in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. It offers a user-friendly interface for generating captions for images and can be used for a variety of applications, including content tagging, image indexing, and accessibility support.
